# Task-Scheduler
This repository features a "Task Scheduler" built using Python, leveraging key data structures to efficiently organize and execute tasks. The scheduler prioritizes tasks, handles dependencies, and simulates real-world scheduling scenarios. Key Features:

Priority Management : Uses priority queues to ensure high-priority tasks are handled first.
Dependency Resolution : Tasks can depend on others, and the scheduler ensures correct execution order.
Core Data Structures : Implements essential structures like queues, heaps, and graphs for robust performance. How It Works:
Add Tasks: Create tasks with details such as priority and dependencies.
Execution Management: Tasks are scheduled and executed in a structured order.
Monitor Progress: Track task status and execution flow. Technologies:
Python
Data Structures (Priority Queues, Graphs, Heaps)
